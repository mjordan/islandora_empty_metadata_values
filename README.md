# Islandora Empty Metadata Values

## Introduction

Simple utility module that hides Islandora metadata elements that are empty or that consist only of puncutation. Works with default Dublin Core metadata displays as well as metadata displays managed by Islandora Solr Metadata.

Note that this module works independently of the "Omit Empty Values" option in Islandora Solr's General Configuration settings.
